## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
getwd()
EV_data <- read.csv("data_ZEV_asthmaED_2013_2022.csv")
```

```{r}
#Getting number of EVs per 1000 people
nZEV1000pop <- EV_data$nZEV/EV_data$pop *1000
#RoA = Rate of Asthma
log_AgeAdj_RoA_ED_Visit_Rate <- log(EV_data$Age_Adjusted_Rate_of_Asthma_ED_Visit_Rate)
#Getting LN to help create better plots 
```

```{r}
#Summary Stats by all years
summary_stats_allyrs <- c(
summary(EV_data$Age_Adjusted_Rate_of_Asthma_ED_Visit_Rate),
SD=sd(EV_data$Age_Adjusted_Rate_of_Asthma_ED_Visit_Rate))
#mean(41.90) --> #there are about 41.90 visits to ED per 10,000ppl
#Sd(28.98) --> there is huge variance between zip codes and ppl in ED 
```

```{r}
#Summary Stats by each year
tapply(EV_data$Age_Adjusted_Rate_of_Asthma_ED_Visit_Rate)
```
